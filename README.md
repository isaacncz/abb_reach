# ABBReach-v0
The repo consists of all the files developed and used throughout my final year project witht the title 'MANIPULATOR ARM CONTROL AND TASK TRAINING USING DEEP REINFORCEMENT LEARNING'. The environment is developed using OpenAi Gym API. Training is done using algorithms from [Stable Baseline 3](https://github.com/DLR-RM/stable-baselines3 ) and [rl-baseline3-zoo](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo). The algorithms used are TD3, SAC and TQC. Hyperparameters are tuned using Optuna, which can be found in [rl-baseline3-zoo](https://github.com/DLR-RM/rl-baselines3-zoo/blob/master/utils/hyperparams_opt.py).
